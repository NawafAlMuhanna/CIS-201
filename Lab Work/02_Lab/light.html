	<p>Nate tries to search for nearest light switch, he started to realize how big the area he's in right now. He finally reached a wall and managed to feel some sort of a switch, he fliped it on and the whole room lit up.
	
	Nate notices a window right next to him and door and the other side of the room.</p>
	
	<p>He ponders as to what to do next?</p>
